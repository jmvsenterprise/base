 * This file declares the str struct and functions that manipulate it. The str
 * is the only string you'll ever need. Dynamic allocation should be handled by
 * a more efficient structure like a buffer anyway. I recommend the pool.
 *
 * The str stores a pointer to the data it refers to and the "length" of the
 * string, or the number of characters in the data it refers to as being part of
 * the string.
